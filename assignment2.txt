   To finish the wack-a-mole game's basic logic using native javascript or jQuery library
due date:
    October 26, 2020 by noon

specifications:
    Find the basecode in the assignment folder and use it as a scaffold of your work.
    There are two paths to approach the goal: solo and with-a-peer. If you choose only to finish the core functionalities of the game then you work independently and to be eligible to enter a peer work context, you have to implement at least two of the extended features.
    core (mandatory):
    score evaluating and display (40%)
    end of game logic (40%)
    and a game over display (20%)

    extended (optional):
    countdown effect
    miss hit effect (turning one mole figure in the life bar to grey)
    hit effect (poping scores, adding sound, adding animations, etc)
    record high function
    
    You have to clearly document your work by adding comments to your code so I can catch the intention of your code easily. If you finish the work
with a peer, you will also need to submit a text file describing the part you focused on.
